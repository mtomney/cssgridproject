===Grid Layout Project===

    The following is a project used to design a simple responsive grid system using only HTML 5 and CSS (no frameworks i.e. Bootstrap). This was accomplished by designing our own div/grid system and creating specific columns by percentages. This is meant to be a very simple mockup article site to show the ability to develop a responsive grid from scratch in CSS. 


    To examine, open the index.html file. Resizing the viewport will show how the content adjusts based on screen size.
